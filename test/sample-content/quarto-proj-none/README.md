# quarto-proj-none

A minimal Quarto project that uses no runtimes and exercises as little functionality as possible.

- The RStudio IDE project and Quarto project were created using the IDE, with the "Use visual markdown editor" option selected.
- The `manifest.json` was pulled from the source bundle after using push-button deployment in the IDE, and manually edited to remove `.Rprofile` and `packrat.lock`, which are (at time of writing, 2022-02-09) automatically added by the IDE.

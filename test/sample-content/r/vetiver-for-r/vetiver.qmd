# Outline

This Jump Start example provides an example for you to follow along with to:

- Version a trained model using [pins](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/pins/)
- Deploy the model as an API

# Prework: Environment Variables

Prior to beginning, environment variables must be set in your development environment for vetiver to work on Connect.

1.  Create an API key for Posit Connect: [Learn How](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/api-keys/)
2.  Create a `.Renviron` file in your working directory to store the API key and Posit Connect server address variables.

Example `.Renviron` file contents:

```{verbatim}
CONNECT_SERVER="<your-connect-server>"
CONNECT_API_KEY="<your-connect-api-key>"
```

# Create a vetiver model

For this example, let’s work with data on fuel efficiency for cars to predict miles per gallon.

```{r}
car_mod <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
```

This model uses the `lm()` function in base R, but you can use vetiver with [many kinds of models trained in R](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/get-started/#installation).

We can create a `vetiver_model()` in R from the trained model; a vetiver model object collects the information needed to store, version, and deploy a trained model.

```{r}
library(vetiver)
v <- vetiver_model(car_mod, "cars-mpg")
v
```

Think of this vetiver model as a deployable model object.

# Store and version your model

You can store and version your model by using Connect as a pins "board". 

:::{.callout-tip}
For more on using pins, see the pins tutorial Jump Start example. 
:::

When we write the vetiver model to our board, the binary model object is stored on our board together with necessary metadata, like the packages needed to make a prediction and the model's input data prototype for checking new data at prediction time.

```{r}
library(pins)
board <- board_rsconnect()
board %>% vetiver_pin_write(v)
```

:::{.callout-note}
Note that the model was stored as `my.username/cars-mpg`, where `my.username` is _your_ username on your Connect server.
:::

If you train a different model (say, a different kind of model or with updated data) you can store the new model in the same pin; you will have access to both.

# Deploy your model

You can deploy your model with the function `vetiver_deploy_rsconnect()`.

:::{.callout-tip}
*Before you run the next code chunk*: Update `my.username` to your own username on your Connect server.
For real applications, the username for the pin and the account deploying the model API do not have to be the same.
:::

```{r}
library(plumber)
vetiver_deploy_rsconnect(
  board = board, 
  name = "my.username/pin_name",
  account = "my.username"
)
```

Now you can interact with the visual documentation for your deployed model at its new URL on Connect, or [even get predictions from R](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/vetiver/#predict-from-your-model-endpoint).

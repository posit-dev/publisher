# Tableau R Extension

## About this example

plumbertableau is an R package that enables R developers to build Plumber APIs that function as Tableau Analytics Extensions. These extensions can be leveraged from Tableau workbooks to allow real time requests from Tableau to R. This extension builds on top of Tableau's example Superstore dataset.

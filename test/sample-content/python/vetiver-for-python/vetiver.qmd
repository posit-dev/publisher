# Outline

This Jump Start example provides an example for you to follow along with to:

- Version a trained model using [pins](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/pins/)
- Deploy the model as an API

# Prework: Environment Variables

Prior to beginning, environment variables must be set in your development environment for vetiver to work on Connect.

1.  Create an API key for Posit Connect: [Learn How](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/api-keys/)
2.  Create a `.env` file in your working directory to store the API key and Posit Connect server address variables.

Example `.env` file contents:

```{verbatim}
CONNECT_SERVER=<your-connect-server>
CONNECT_API_KEY=<your-connect-api-key>
```

# Create a vetiver model

For this example, let’s work with data on fuel efficiency for cars to predict miles per gallon.

```{python}
from vetiver.data import mtcars
from sklearn import linear_model

car_mod = linear_model.LinearRegression().fit(mtcars.drop(columns="mpg"), mtcars["mpg"])
```

This model uses the `LinearRegression()` model in scikit-learn, but you can use vetiver with [many kinds of models trained in Python](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/get-started/#installation).

We can create a `VetiverModel()` in Python from the trained model; a vetiver model object collects the information needed to store, version, and deploy a trained model.

```{python}
from vetiver import VetiverModel
v = VetiverModel(car_mod, model_name = "my.username/cars-mpg", 
                prototype_data = mtcars.drop(columns="mpg"))
v.description
```

Think of this vetiver model as a deployable model object.

:::{.callout-note}
Note that the model was stored as `my.username/cars-mpg`, where `my.username` is _your_ username on your Connect server.
:::

# Store and version your model

You can store and version your model by using Connect as a pins "board". 

:::{.callout-tip}
For more on using pins for Python, see the [Connect pins docs](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/python-pins/). 
:::

When we write the vetiver model to our board, the binary model object is stored on our board together with necessary metadata, like the packages needed to make a prediction and the model's input data prototype for checking new data at prediction time.

```{python}
import os
from pins import board_rsconnect
from vetiver import vetiver_pin_write
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

rsc_server = os.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER")
rsc_key = os.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")

board = board_rsconnect(api_key = rsc_key, server_url = rsc_server, allow_pickle_read = True)
vetiver_pin_write(board, v)
```

If you train a different model (say, a different kind of model or with updated data) you can store the new model in the same pin; you will have access to both.

# Deploy your model

You can deploy your model with the function `deploy_rsconnect()`.

:::{.callout-tip}
*Before you run the next code chunk*: Update `my.username` to your own username on your Connect server.
:::

```{python}
from rsconnect.api import RSConnectServer
from vetiver import deploy_rsconnect

connect_server = RSConnectServer(url = rsc_server, api_key = rsc_key)

deploy_rsconnect(
  connect_server = connect_server, 
  board = board, 
  pin_name = "my.username/cars-mpg"
)
```
  
Now you can interact with the visual documentation for your deployed model at its new URL on Connect, or [even get predictions from Python](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/vetiver/#predict-from-your-model-endpoint).

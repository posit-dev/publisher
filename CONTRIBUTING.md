## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installing

To get your development environment up and running, invoke the default Just command.

```console
just
```

On success, a `publisher` executable will exist in the `./bin` directory.

### Execution

Invoke the following Just command to run the built executable.

```console
just run
```

## Testing

This project follows the guidance written by _Ham Vocke_ in the _[The Practical Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)._ Please read the article for a detailed overview of different test types and how they are utilized.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are written in Go and utilize the [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) framework for assertions and mocking.

```console
just test
```

#### Coverage Reporting

Coverage reporting is captured by the [cover](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cover) standard library. To capture coverage, run the following Just command:

```console
just cover
```

Once complete, a coverage report will open in your default browser.

### Integration Tests

The [Bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework is used to perform integration tests. For this project we use Bats to assert integrations with native machines via the Bash shell.

```
just bats
```

## Development

### Build Tools

The build tooling entrypoint is `just`. See the [installation instructions](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) for your operating system to install Just.

Execute `just -l` for a list of available commands and documentation.

### Environment Variables

When executing commands the following variables are accepted to change behavior.

| Variable | Default | Type | Description                                                                           |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CI       | false   | bool | Enable CI mode. When set to true, multi-platform builds are enabled.                  |
| DEBUG    | false   | bool | Enable DEBUG mode. When set to true, `set +x` is enabled for all Justfile targets.    |
| MODE     | dev     | enum | When set to `dev`, development is enabled. All other values disable development mode. |

#### Behavior in GitHub Actions

When running in GitHub Actions, the env variable `CI` is set to `true` by GitHub. When `CI=true`, the defaults for the following values are adjusted.

This mode can be reproduced on your local machine by setting `CI=true`.

| Variable | Default |
| -------- | ------- |
| MODE     | prod    |

### Extension Development

See [the Contribution Guide for the VSCode Extension](./extensions/vscode/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Schema Updates

Non-breaking or additive changes to the schema do not require a version bump.

Breaking changes to the schema require a version bump.

As Pull Requests are merged into main, we update (or create in the case of a new
schema) the file on the CDN (in S3).

Schemas can be found in the `internal/schema/schemas` directory.

## Release

The Posit Publisher VSCode extension releases follow guidelines from the
[VSCode Publishing Extensions docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions).

[SemVer versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) is used , but the
VSCode Marketplace will only support `major.minor.patch` for extension versions,
semver pre-release tags are not supported.

The recommendation is releases use `major.EVEN_NUMBER.patch` for release
versions and `major.ODD_NUMBER.patch` for pre-release versions.

CI facilitates this and will automatically publish as a pre-release if the
minor version number is odd.

### Before Releasing

- Ensure that all relevant changes are documented in:
  - the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the repository
  - the [VSCode Extension CHANGELOG.md](extensions/vscode/CHANGELOG.md)
    that is bundled with the extension
  - Update the Installation instructions in [installation.md](docs/installation.md)
    for the new release, using the links to the `.vsix` files uploaded to the CDN.
  - Update the release / latest version string in the `install-publisher.bash` script.
- Update the license docs in case any new dependencies have been added, by running

```
just docs/licenses
```

and committing any changes.

### Instructions

**Step 1**

Create a proper SemVer and extension version compatible tag using the guidelines
above.

Use an even minor version for releases, or an odd minor version for
pre-releases.

_For this example, we will use the tag `v1.1.0` to create a pre-release. This
tag already exists, so you will not be able run the following commands
verbatim._

`git tag v1.1.0`

**Step 2**

Push the tag GitHub.

`git push origin v1.1.0`

This command will trigger the [Release GitHub Action](https://github.com/rstudio/publishing-client/actions/workflows/release.yaml).

**Step 3**

Once complete the action has completed, the release will be available on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/rstudio/publishing-client/releases), and
published to the VSCode Marketplace.

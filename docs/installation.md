## Quick install and updates

We have updates scripts for macOS and linux to download and install the latest version of the publisher:

#### Setup (one time)

First, [download the update script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/publisher/main/install-publisher.bash) you will also have to mark it executable:

```bash

chmod u+x install-publisher.bash
```

You can put the script somewhere on your `$PATH` so you can run it from any directory, or add it to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

#### Usage

Run the script as follows:

```bash
./install-publisher.bash
```

Which will install the most recent release of the publisher.

You can also install nightlies with:

```bash
./install-publisher.bash nightly
```

Or install a specific version with:

```bash
./install-publisher.bash 1.0.beta1
```

## Optional: Install Quarto

If you plan on deploying Quarto content having Quarto installed will allow
Posit Publisher to correctly detect Quarto application types for easier
deploying.

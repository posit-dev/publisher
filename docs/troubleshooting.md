# Troubleshooting Posit Publisher

This document contains some common issues and solutions for Posit Publisher.

## The Configuration has a schema error

If deploying results in the following error:

> Failed to deploy. The Configuration has a schema error

This occurs when there is a problem with the Deployment's Configuration file.
This can occur due to a missing field, an incorrect value, or even a typo.

Using an extension like [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
can help catch problems in the Configuration by providing syntax highlighting,
completion, and hover text using the schema provided by Posit Publisher.

Carefully check your Configuration file for any errors, and refer to the
[Configuration File reference documentation](https://github.com/posit-dev/publisher/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)
for more details on the fields and values that are expected.

## Deployed content does not seem to be running

The Posit Publisher attempts to access the content on the Posit Connect server after
the deployment process. This error occurs when the publisher's attempt times out or
encounters an error.

The deployment logs available on Posit Connect will normally provide more insight into
the details of the runtime failure that occurred.

Often times, the resolution will involve simply updating the dependencies within the
`requirements.txt` or `renv.lock` file (depending on the type of content), and then
redeploying. Update your dependencies and make sure your project runs successfully
locally. Increasing the dependency specification by not only specifying the dependency
package but also the version to be used will often overcome the issue.

## Unrecognized app mode

If when deploying you see the following error:

> Cannot process manifest: Unrecognized app mode

check your Configuration for the following:

### `type = 'unknown'`

If your Configuration file contains `type = 'unknown'`, either from the
generated Configuration being unable to identify the type of your content, or
if it was set to the `unknown` type manually, you will see this error.

The Posit Publisher extension view will show an alert when this occurs, asking
for the framework you are using to be set using the `type` field in your
Configuration.

To fix this you will need to find and set the `type` in your Configuration file.
Supported types can be found in the [Configuration File Reference documentation](https://github.com/posit-dev/publisher/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#type).

### Unsupported `type`

If the Posit Connect server you are deploying to is older than the version that
introduced support for the `type` set in your configuration file, you will see
the "Cannot process manifest: Unrecognized app mode" error.

For example, [Posit Connect 2024.12.0](https://docs.posit.co/connect/news/#posit-connect-2024.12.0-new)
introduced support for Gradio apps. Attempting to deploy a Gradio app to a
server running a version of Posit Connect older than 2024.12.0 will result in
this error.

## `renv` errors on deployment

When deploying `R` projects, it is essential that Posit Publisher has
access to a record of the dependencies used by your project to reproduce
the project on Posit Connect.
The [`renv` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) can
create that record as a `lockfile` (commonly named `renv.lock`).

If an R project doesn't have a `lockfile` on deploy, Posit Publisher prompts to
provide a solution to generate the expected `lockfile`.

Projects that already include a `lockfile` do not require `renv` be setup.

When uncommon errors occur that Posit Publisher cannot solve for you, it
prompts to evaluate the status of `renv` using
[`renv::status()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/status.html).

## `EOF` error on deployment

When deploying to a Posit Connect server, it is possible to encounter the error:
`Post "http://<Your Connect Server>/__api__/v1/content": EOF.`. This occurs when
a request is sent to a Connect server before it is ready to service the request.

Retrying the operation after the Posit Connect server has completed its initialization
and is available for connections, should resolve the issue. Try establishing a connection
directly to the Posit Connect dashboard to confirm that the server is available.

## Deployment type mismatches

By default, a new deployment created within the Posit Publisher will create a new
deployment on the Posit Connect server. Each deployment uses an identifier referred to
as the Content GUID, which the Posit Publisher records during the first deployment along
with the content type. When a deployment is redeployed, this identifier is used to update the piece of content
on the Connect server rather than creating a new deployment.

The Posit Publisher provides the ability to associate a deployment with a different
server deployment. It is the responsibility of the publisher to make sure that the
content type of the deployment is the same as the content type of the server deployment.

Mismatches are not identified during the association operation, but instead are identifying
during the next deployment operation. If mismatched, an error similar to the following will
be displayed:

`Content was previously deployed as 'jupyter-notebook' but your configuration is set to 'r-shiny’`

Posit Connect does not allow the content type of a deployment to be changed. If you encounter this
error, your best option is to create and deploy a new deployment.

## Publisher Output

Publisher output may help to track down problems, it is located in the "Output" window under the "Posit Publisher Deployment" option.

The Output Panel in VSCode or Positron can be opened with ⇧+⌘+U in Mac, Ctrl+⇧+U in Windows.

When opening an issue it is okay to copy and paste the output as is, you can also provide this output
by saving it into a file and attaching it to the issue.

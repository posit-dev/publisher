# Collaborative Publishing with Posit Publisher

This workflow guide explains how to collaborate with others on deployed content.

## Configuration and Deployment files

Posit Publisher creates and utilizes two `.toml` files for deploying content.
Both are inside of the `.posit/publish` directory alongside your entrypoint
file.

- The Configuration file describes how the content will be deployed to Posit
  Connect. It can be edited by hand and by interacting with the Posit
  Publisher sidebar. It is named using the content's title and a unique
  identifier, for example, `content-title-061E.toml`. See the
  [Configuration file reference](./configuration.md) for a full list of
  settings.
- The Deployment file details where the content was deployed and its state.
  Deployment files are automatically generated by Posit Publisher in the
  `deployment` directory and updated during deploys. They are not meant to be
  edited. Posit Publisher will take care of this file for you so you do not need
  to think about it aside from the collaboration tips below.

Utilizing both of these files, alongside a credential and collaborator access
on Posit Connect, you and your collaborators can update and configure the same
content. To grant others collaborator access see
[Posit Connect User Guide- Access list settings](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/content-settings/#set-collaborators).

## With source control

Configuration and Deployment files found in `./posit/publish` are intended
to be committed into source repositories.

Once tracked in source control, anyone with access can easily collaborate on the
same content.

After a deploy be sure to commit any changes to the Configuration and Deployment
files. Keeping them in sync with the content on Posit Connect will ensure that
collaborators have the most up-to-date details to continue where others left
off.

## Without source control

Include the Deployment and Configuration files in your deployment and others can
use them to collaborate by downloading the files from Posit Connect. Posit
Publisher includes both automatically in configurations it generates.

Whenever content is deployed to Posit Connect a content bundle is created
containing the files. Ensure files you would like collaborators to have access
to are in the [Configuration's Project `files`](./vscode.md#project-files).
Content bundles can be downloaded using the **Source Versions** tool.

See
[Posit Connect User Guide - Source Versions](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/source-versions/)
for more information on the content bundle source versions and
how to download them.

## Tips

### Stay updated while collaborating

While collaborating on content, stay updated with the latest changes others have
made.

To do so, either pull down the latest changes from your source control system or
download the content bundle from the latest Source Version on Posit Conect.

Doing so ensures that you have the most up-to-date content, but also
configuration settings and deployment details.

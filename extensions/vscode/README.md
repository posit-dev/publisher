### Option 2

Configure your shell with executable on path and alias it to `publisher`.

Here is an example using ZSH on macOS with an M1 Chip (ARM64 architecture).

**~/.zshenv**
```shell
# Replace this with the location of the executable on your machine.
PATHNAME=$HOME/Downloads/connect-client-0.0.dev2-darwin-arm64

export PATH=$PATH:$PATHNAME
alias publisher=$(basename ${PATHNAME})
```

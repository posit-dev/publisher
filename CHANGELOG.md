## [1.16.0]

### Added

- Added support for deploying to Connect in Snowflake using key-pair auth. (#2632)

## [1.14.0]

### Added

- Introduced detection of required R interpreter version based on
  `DESCRIPTION` file and `renv.lock` file. The detected version
  will fill the `requires_r` field in configuration (#2636)

### Fixed

  Now the dependencies file is properly named `requirements.txt`. (#2639)

## [1.12.1]

### Fixed

- Fix missing platform build in OpenVSX due to outage.

### Changed

- Updated `record.toml` to correspond with updated schema change in v1.12

## [1.12.0]

### Added

- Added the ability to update the target GUID for a deployment at any time
  from the "..." menu. (#2576)
- Added a new extension setting `Use Key Chain Credential Storage`
  (defaulting to true), allowing the user to prioritize the use
  of a credential file over the keyring. (#2519)
- Credentials are now exposed via a `posit-connect` authentication provider,
  which is surfaced within the native Accounts UI. (#2608)
- Added a new extension setting `Default Connect Server` to pre-populate
  the Server URL when creating a credential if there is not already one
  configured. When running within Posit Workbench, the extension will use the
  URL from the [default RStudio/Posit Workbench setting](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/rstudio_pro_sessions/rstudio_connect_server.html) (rstudio-pro#7466)
- When expanded, the Python Packages view will now display a message describing
  how to configure the project to use Python if the configuration file does not
  indicate a dependency on Python. (#2571)
- Added a new field to the Python configuration section ("requires_python"),
  which can be used to indicate the range of Python interpreter versions
  required to run the content on the Connect server. If it is not provided,
  it is populated from the project files ".python-version", "pyproject.toml" and
  "setup.cfg". This setting is inserted into the manifest during
  deployment. (#2617)

### Fixed

- Publisher icon was sometimes missing when workpace folder starts out
  untrusted in VS Code. The extension now supports running within both untrusted and
  trusted workspaces, and will prompt to manage workspace trust so it can initialize. (#2611)

### Changed

- R, Python, and Quarto versions are now optional in configuration files and
  will not be populated when creating a new deployment. If not present at the
  time of deployment, versions will be discovered and inserted from user's
  running environment. (#2468, #2470)
- The `posit-publishing-schema-v3` configuration file schema has been updated
  with the new "Python.requires_python" field as well as the switch from required to
  optional for the version field within the R, Python and Quarto sections.
- The Publisher Log Panel has now been renamed to "Publisher" and now will
  stay hidden until the user initiates a deployment operation from within the
  extension. It remains visible until the VSCode window is restarted. (#2596)
- End-to-end tests environment refactored (#2508, #2588 & #2589 - Project)
- Legacy CLI code removed (#2521 - Project)

## [1.10.0]

### Added

- Added a new [Troubleshooting document](https://github.com/posit-dev/publisher/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)
  and a link to it in error notifications that occur during deployment. (#2562)
- Added a new [Collaboration document](https://github.com/posit-dev/publisher/blob/main/docs/collaboration.md)
  describing how to collaborate on projects using the Posit Publisher. (#2383)
- Added support for deploying Gradio content to Posit Connect. (#2476, #2477)
- Inspection for Gradio entrypoint files was added to correctly determine when
  it is Gradio content and setting `type = 'python-gradio'` in the generated
  configuration file. (#2475)
- When deploying R content without a `lockfile` the extension now prompts the
  user to install and setup `renv` then creates a `renv.lock` depending on what
  is needed in their environment. (#2560)
- The Python interpreter used is now consistent across the extension and
  uses the selected Python intrepter in Positron or the
  [VS Code Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
  defaulting to the Python on PATH when none is selected. (#2494, #2496)
- A warning has been added to the sidebar when the selected deployment has a
  configuration with `type = 'unknown'` suggesting the framework be set. (#2515)
- Icons have been added to the deployment select dropdown to indicate the
  deployment's server and entrypoint. (#2483)

### Fixed

- Deployment dismissal has been greatly improved. Deployments are no longer
  updated as the deploy continues on Posit Connect. They instead will be set to
  the dismissed state, avoiding changes after dismissal. (#2179, #2498)
- Fixed an issue where the "View Content" button could appear when a deployment
  failed prior to any content being created on Posit Connect. (#2373)

### Changed

- The Python and R package files can no longer be un-checked in the Project
  Files view to avoid unintended removal from the `files` attribute in the
  configuration. (#2555)
- The sidebar design was unified to have similar different vertical placement in
  various deployment states. (#2531)
- Warnings in the sidebar have a new look to optimize horizontal space, utilize
  theme colors, and emphasize links. (#2526, #2527)
- The error when the extension could not validate credentials has been improved
  to indicate that connectivity to the server could also be a problem. (#2450)

## [1.8.0]

### Added

- The selected R interpreter in Positron is preferred over an R interpreter on
  PATH when inspecting an entrypoint. When a deployment is created the selected
  R version is used in the generated configuration where applicable. (#2500)

### Fixed

- When utilizing file-based credential storage and the file is using an older
  format, or has been corrupted, the file is backed up and the user is prompted
  to re-enter their credentials. (#2491)
- If corrupted credentials are detected inside of keychain storage the store
  will be reset and the user will be prompted to re-enter their credentials.
  (#2492)

### Changed

- The entrypoint can no longer be un-checked in the Project Files view to avoid
  unintended removal from the `files` attribute in the configuration. (#2487)
- The sidebar design has changed slightly to emphasize the deployment selection.
  (#2480, #2481)
- The deployment selection field in the sidebar now uses a right chevron to
  indicate dropdown will appear as a VS Code Quick Pick. (#2482)

## [1.6.0]

### Added

- Added emphasis to the entrypoint file for the selected deployment in the
  Project Files view (#2239)
- When running the extension in Positron the selected R interpreter is now used
  rather than using the R interpreter from the PATH (#1968)
- Added improved inspection for RMarkdown sites. When a `_site.yml` or
  `_bookdown.yml` file present the content category is correctly set to `site`.
  (#1643)
- Added improved inspection and initial configurations for Quarto Websites when
  a `_quarto.yml` is present. Pre and post scripts are now automatically
  included in the initial configuration. (#2266)

### Fixed

- Fixed the extension sidebar freezing when a deployment with a large number of
  files is selected (#2204)

## [1.4.0]

### Changed

- Changed the behavior when the configuration has `type = 'unknown'`. Now
  several actions can be performed such as including/excluding files via
  the sidebar and re-deploying to Posit Connect if the content type was deployed
  with the unknown type. (#2419)
- Changed the `quarto` type to `quarto-static` to match Posit Connect. The
  type `quarto` has been deprecated, and it is recommended to use
  `quarto-static`. (#1208)

### Added

- Added support for deploying Quarto script files (#1208)
- Improved the Secrets view in the sidebar to show when the secret is already
  set for the content on Posit Connect, when a value is going to be set on
  deploy, and when a value needs to be set (#2365)
- Added the ability to hide all input cells or hide input cells with the
  `hide_input` metadata tag in Jupyter notebooks using a new section in
  configuration files (#2399)

### Fixed

  causing errors and not creating all necessary files (#2419)
- Fixed unknown inspection occassionally not including the selected entrypoint
  in the generated configuration's files list (#2419)
- Fixed a behavior causing `renv.lock` related errors to show in the Posit
  Publisher output channel and a vague "Could not scan..." message being
  shown. Now the specific errors are displayed for easier resolution. (#2408)
- Replaced an unhelpful error with a much more informative message when
  attempting to inspect a Python file and a Python executable can not be found
  to do the inspection (#2385)

## [1.2.1]

### Changed

- Updated extension README.md to include an outline of the features provided and links to the documentation and issue board.

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- Improved documentation around the file inclusion, git ignore pattern used in
  configuration files (#2359)

  button. Instead, errors are displayed during the deployment process to better
  indicate what needs to be addressed (#2345, #2374)
- Added a line number to the configuration file error message to better indicate
  where the schema validation error is occurring (#2330)
- Added a more informative error when the Content ID is not found on the
  Connect server when updating an existing deployment (#2287)
- Added more logging to the extension output to help diagnose issues (#2153)
- Added an option to disable certificate verification when communicating with a
  Connect server (#2202)

  and link to the content's logs directly (#2206)
- Changed URL validation when adding a Connect server credential to allow for
  URLs with paths (#2001)
- Changed URL validation to automatically discover the proper Connect server
  API endpoint based on the URL provided by the user (often incorrect) (#2001)
- Changed unexpected errors to be briefer, with additional details being sent
  to the VSCode's Output/Window pane
- Removed the Scan button from the R Packages view and updated the message to
  include a link to the `renv` documentation when the R package file is missing,
  invalid or empty (#2403)

### Fixed

  view. Secret names can be added to the Configuration, and values supplied
  individually in the Secrets view. (#2260, #2304, #2305)
- Newly made Deployments can now be associated with previously deployed content
  to easily update content on a Connect server. (#2285)
- Views that require action now show a warning icon when collapsed to assist in
  discovery (#2245)

  upgrading. (#1831)
- Files that have previously been deployed that are now deselected for the
  next deployment show a red `R` icon in the Project Files view (#2299)

### Changed

- When creating a new deployment, open entrypoint files are listed with an
  option to use an open file dialog to select any file. This removes a recursive
  search for all entrypoints present within the open workspace. (#2337)
- The entrypoint file is now more prominent in the UI. It is visible in the
  Deployment selection and options when selecting (#2248)
- Changed the editor button tooltip wording for deployable files. It now reads
  "Deploy with Posit Publisher" (#2209)
- The Credentials and Help views are now shown even when no Deployment is

  re-deploys. It will continue to assist in selection of deployments (#2180)
- Moved the "Create a New Deployment" option in Deployment selection menus to
  the top of the list for easier discovery (#2110)
- Changed the naming of generated configuration files to be more unique. They
  are now based on the entered content title and include a short unique hash to
  avoid collisions in source control (#2135)

### Fixed

- When creating a Shiny Express deployment the entrypoint is now included in the
  generated configuration file (#2137)
- Reduced the number of workspace file scanning operations done when a large
  number of files are deleted in the workspace to improve performance (#2107)

- Added sorting of entrypoints when adding a new deployment including open files
  at the top of the list (#2045)

### Changed

- The Posit Publisher button in the editor view for entrypoints now does not
  deploy after a new deployment is created - giving users time to review the
  newly created configuration before deploying (#2060)
- Changed the scanning of entrypoints when adding a new deployment - now a
  cursory scan is done using file extensions and a full inspection is only done
  on the selected entrypoint greatly improving the speed of adding a new
  deployment (#2029)
- Changed the initial listing of entrypoints, when adding a new deployment, to
  only show unique options rather duplications for each content type (#2046)

  lists did not correctly handle specified files in subdirectories (#2075)
- Fixed the Python Packages list including a blank entry when whitespace was
  present in the `requirements.txt` file (#2033)

  (#2032)
- Fixed an issue with entrypoint inspection where a non-PyShiny entrypoint would
  cause other files from being scanned (#2011)
- Fixed anchor links opening new tabs in web based VSCodes including in

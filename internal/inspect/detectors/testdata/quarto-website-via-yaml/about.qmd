This [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) shows how the [Posit
Connect Server API](https://docs.posit.co/connect/api/) can combine with
[Quarto Listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) to
create dashboards that highlight your content.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

import yaml
with open("featured.yaml", "r") as f:
    featured = len(yaml.safe_load(f))
with open("all.yaml", "r") as f:
    listing = len(yaml.safe_load(f))

print(f"This dashboard presents {featured} featured content items with {listing} total items.")
```
